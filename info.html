<p> t-shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).

Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a "dress shirt", a specific type of collared shirt). A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.V-Neck
A V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped neckline, as opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt (also called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the shirt does not show when worn beneath an outer shirt, as would that of a crew neck shirtA T-shirt is a type of fabric shirt that is named after the T shape of its body and sleeves. It is traditionally made of stretchy, light, and inexpensive fabric, such as cotton textile in a stockinette or jersey knit, which has a distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. T-shirts are generally designed with short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a crew neck, which lacks a collar. Some modern versions have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a circular knitting machine, such that the torso has no side seams. They are easy to clean and have become a popular choice for casual wear 1.

The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a laser or a water jet 1. T-shirts are inexpensive to produce and are often part of fast fashion, leading to outsized sales of T-shirts compared to other attire 1. For example, two billion T-shirts are sold per year in the United States, and the average person in Sweden buys nine T-shirts a year 1."</p>
